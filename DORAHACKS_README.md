## üéØ What We Built on SEI

**SEI Growth** is an AI-powered market intelligence platform that brings **blockchain oracle capabilities to mainstream social media platforms**. We built a system of intelligent agents that analyze community conversations and publish real-time market signals to the SEI blockchain.

### **Core Innovation: AI Agents + SEI Oracle**

We created **4 specialized AI agents** that work together to transform social media conversations into blockchain-verified market intelligence:

1. **üîç Keywords Generator Agent** - Extracts relevant hashtags from business descriptions
2. **üê¶ Twitter Collector Agent** - Gathers and processes community conversations  
3. **üß† Insights Compiler Agent** - Analyzes sentiment and generates market insights
4. **‚õìÔ∏è Oracle Agent** - Publishes verified signals to SEI blockchain

### **Why SEI Blockchain?**

SEI's **1-second finality** and **ultra-low fees** make it perfect for real-time market signals. Traditional oracles are too slow and expensive for live market intelligence. SEI enables us to publish signals as fast as conversations happen.

## ‚õìÔ∏è SEI Integration & Utility

### **How Our AI Agents Integrate with SEI**

Our AI agents create a **bridge between social media conversations and SEI blockchain** through a sophisticated integration pipeline:

1. **üîç Data Collection**: AI agents analyze Twitter conversations in real-time
2. **üß† Signal Processing**: Natural language processing extracts market insights
3. **‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain Publication**: Verified signals are published to SEI oracle
4. **üîê Immutable Storage**: All data becomes permanently verifiable on-chain


### **Technical Integration Points**

| Component | SEI Integration | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Oracle Contract** | Smart contract on SEI | Stores market signals permanently |
| **IPFS Storage** | CID references on SEI | Links to raw social media data |
| **Transaction Verification** | SEI explorer integration | Public verification of all signals |
| **Real-Time Updates** | SEI's fast finality | Instant market intelligence |

**SEI transforms our AI analysis from ephemeral insights into permanent, verifiable market intelligence that anyone can trust and build upon.**
